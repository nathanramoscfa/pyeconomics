"""The installed registry holds the catalog, so the suites over it check something.

The golden harness and the contract suite parametrize over the installed
registry. If discovery found nothing (a missing entry point, a broken install),
they would collect no case and pass. This test makes an empty registry fail, and
pins the domains Phase 2 Steps 6 and 8 registered.
