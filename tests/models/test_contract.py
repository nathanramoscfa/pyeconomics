"""Every registered model keeps the contract in ``tests/contract.py``.

For inputs generated from each model's fields, a run stays within its output
bounds, returns finite numbers or a documented ``None``, raises only the
documented errors, repeats itself exactly and survives a round trip through its
canonical JSON. The inputs per model are bounded by its cost class.

``test_contract_rules.py`` holds the checks themselves to account with toy
models, and ``test_registry_is_not_empty.py`` fails if discovery finds nothing
to parametrize over.
