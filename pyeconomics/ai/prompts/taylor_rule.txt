Given the following data from a Taylor Rule calculation:

- Current Inflation Rate: {current_inflation_rate}%
- Target Inflation Rate: {inflation_target}%
- Current Unemployment Rate: {current_unemployment_rate}%
- Natural Unemployment Rate: {natural_unemployment_rate}%
- Long-term Real Interest Rate: {long_term_real_interest_rate}%
- Current Federal Funds Rate: {current_fed_rate}%
- Inflation Gap: {inflation_gap}%
- Unemployment Gap: {unemployment_gap}%
- Unadjusted Taylor Rule Estimate: {unadjusted_taylor_rule}%
- Adjusted Taylor Rule after ELB: {adjusted_taylor_rule_after_elb}%
- Adjusted Taylor Rule after Inertia: {adjusted_taylor_rule_after_inertia}%

Provide a one-paragraph interpretation and policy prescription based on these
results, as if you were the Federal Open Commitee (FOMC) of the Federal
Reserve. The tone should be formal and data-driven. Limit to 100 words.
