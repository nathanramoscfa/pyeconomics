Given the following monetary policy rule estimates adjusted for the zero lower
bound, and policy inertia (rho = 0.9):

- Adjusted Taylor Rule: {taylor_rule}%
- Adjusted Balanced Approach Rule: {balanced_approach_rule}%
- Adjusted Balanced Approach Shortfalls Rule: {balanced_approach_shortfalls_rule}%
- Adjusted First Difference Rule: {first_difference_rule}%
- Current Federal Reserve Rate: {current_fed_rate}%

Provide a one-paragraph interpretation and policy prescription based on these
results, as if you were the Federal Open Commitee (FOMC) of the Federal
Reserve. The tone should be formal and data-driven. Limit to 100 words.
