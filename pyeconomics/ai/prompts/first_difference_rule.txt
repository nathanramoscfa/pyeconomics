Given the following data from a First Difference Rule calculation:

- Current Inflation Rate: {current_inflation_rate}%
- Target Inflation Rate: {inflation_target}%
- Current Unemployment Rate: {current_unemployment_rate}%
- Lagged Unemployment Rate: {lagged_unemployment_rate}%
- Natural Unemployment Rate: {natural_unemployment_rate}%
- Lagged Natural Unemployment Rate: {lagged_natural_unemployment_rate}%
- Current Federal Funds Rate: {current_fed_rate}%
- Inflation Gap: {inflation_gap}%
- Unemployment Gap: {current_unemployment_gap}%
- Unadjusted First Difference Rule Estimate: {unadjusted_fdr_rule}%
- Adjusted First Difference after ELB: {adjusted_fdr_rule_after_elb}%
- Adjusted First Difference after Inertia: {adjusted_fdr_rule_after_inertia}%

Provide a one-paragraph interpretation and policy prescription based on these
results, as if you were the Federal Open Commitee (FOMC) of the Federal
Reserve. The tone should be formal and data-driven. Limit to 100 words.
