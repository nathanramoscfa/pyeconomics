> **Status: pyeconomics 1.0 is in development.** `pip install pyeconomics`
> installs **0.2.6**, the current stable release. The 1.0 pre-releases install
> only when asked for, with `pip install --pre pyeconomics` or an exact version,
> and they carry no stability promise until 1.0.0.

pyeconomics 1.0 is being rebuilt from the ground up as an open platform of
economics and finance models: a registry of tested, cited models, each written
once and served identically to Python, a command line, a REST API, an MCP server
and a web app. Every result will carry a provenance manifest. It implements
formulas commonly covered in the CFA® Program curriculum, and the wider
economics, econometrics, risk and quant canon after them.

So far, the repository holds the 1.0 package skeleton, its toolchain, security
gate and release pipeline: there is nothing to use yet. The plan, phase by
phase, is in the
[project roadmap](https://github.com/pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics/blob/main/docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md),
and the decisions behind it are in the
[architecture decision records](https://github.com/pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics/tree/main/docs/adr).

## pyeconomics 0.2.x

0.2.6 is the current stable release of the 0.2.x line: four monetary-policy
rules over FRED data.

- It is MIT-licensed. Its source lives on the
  [`legacy/0.2.x`](https://github.com/pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics/tree/legacy/0.2.x)
  branch, and its documentation at <https://pyeconomics.readthedocs.io/>.
- It receives security fixes only, and reaches end of life when 1.0.0 is
  released. Pins such as `pyeconomics<1` keep working.
- 0.2.0 to 0.2.5 log the FRED API key at DEBUG level. Upgrade to 0.2.6 and
  rotate any key those versions used: see advisory
  [GHSA-j6rp-vwwv-jrr8](https://github.com/pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics/security/advisories/GHSA-j6rp-vwwv-jrr8).

## Not to be confused with

This project is not [`davidrpugh/pyeconomics`](https://github.com/davidrpugh/pyeconomics)
(computational-economics course code from 2013–14) or
[pyecon.org](https://pyecon.org/) (a site teaching Python for economics). The
three share only the name.
