# Contributing to pyeconomics

Thank you for helping. pyeconomics 1.0 is being rebuilt phase by phase from the
[project roadmap](docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md); read its §4 for the phase in flight
before proposing large changes. By taking part you agree to the
[Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Report security issues privately, as
[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) describes, never in a public issue.

Coding agents follow [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md), which restates these rules.

## Setup

You need [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and git. Then, once per clone:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics.git
cd pyeconomics
uv sync
uv run prek install
```

`uv sync` installs the package in editable mode with the `dev` dependency
group. `uv run prek install` installs the pre-commit hook that runs the quality
toolchain and the security gate on every commit. There is nothing else to
install: prek builds the pinned gitleaks hook with its own Go toolchain on its
first run.

Run the tests with `uv run pytest`, never `python -m pytest`, which puts the
working directory on `sys.path` and can import a stale copy of the package.
Run every hook by hand with `uv run prek run --all-files`.

## Making a change

1. Open an issue first for anything larger than a small fix, using one of the
   issue forms. A model request needs a citation; a data-source request needs
   the source's terms-of-use URL.
2. Branch from an up-to-date `main` with a prefix from ROADMAP §5 "Branch
   naming convention": `feature/`, `fix/`, `hotfix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`,
   `perf/`, `release/` or `model/`.
3. Commit with sign-off (`git commit -s`; see below). The pre-commit hook must
   pass.
4. Open a pull request against `main` and fill in the template: the roadmap
   step, summary, test plan, breaking changes, rollback plan, licence check and
   sensitive-data checklist.
5. Every required check must pass. Pull requests are squash-merged, so the
   pull request title becomes the commit on `main`.

### Commit conventions

- **Conventional Commits.** The pull request title must match
  `<type>(<scope>)!: <description>`, where type is one of `feat`, `fix`,
  `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore` or
  `revert`; the scope and `!` are optional. `!` (or a `BREAKING CHANGE:`
  footer) marks a breaking change. The `pr-title` check enforces it.
- **DCO sign-off.** Every commit carries a `Signed-off-by:` trailer certifying
  the [Developer Certificate of Origin 1.1](https://developercertificate.org/),
  added by `git commit -s`. The `dco` check requires the trailer's name and
  email to match each commit's author, so set `user.name` and `user.email`
  before committing. Only Dependabot's own pull requests are exempt. To fix a
  branch that lacks sign-offs, run `git rebase --signoff main` and force-push
  your branch.
- **No CLA.** The DCO is the whole of the paperwork (ADR-0004).

### Python file header

Every Python file opens with three comment lines; ruff's `CPY001` requires the
copyright line:

```python
# src/pyeconomics/example.py
# Copyright 2026 Nathan Ramos, CFA
# SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
```

The first line is the file's repository-relative path. YAML and TOML files
start with the same path comment; Markdown and JSON follow their own
conventions.

## The security gate

The pre-commit hook is the project's per-step security gate (ROADMAP §5
"Per-step security gate"): gitleaks for secrets, bandit and semgrep with the
project's rules for SAST, `pip-audit` over `uv.lock` for the dependency audit,
and the runtime licence allowlist. It is fail-closed, and CI re-runs the same
hooks as required checks.

The bypass (`SKIP=<hook>` or `git commit --no-verify`) is for genuine
emergencies only. Every use is recorded in the pull request body's "Security
gate bypass" field with the hook, the commit and why it could not wait. CI still
runs every check, so a bypass never lands an issue on `main`.

## Licence check for dependencies and data sources

pyeconomics is Apache-2.0 from 1.0 (ADR-0004).

- **A new runtime dependency**, meaning anything a user installs with the
  package or an extra, must carry one of `MIT`, `BSD-2-Clause`,
  `BSD-3-Clause`, `Apache-2.0`, `ISC`, `NCSA` or `PSF-2.0`. The `licences` hook
  checks the locked runtime closure. FinancePy, rateslib, getfactormodels, the
  DBnomics client, AGPL OpenBB extensions and MCP servers, and `full_fred` are
  excluded by name. List each new dependency and its licence in the pull
  request.
- **A new data source** must have terms that allow its intended use. Record its
  terms-of-use URL and how ROADMAP §5 "Data licensing policy" classes it
  (hosted-safe or library-only), and carry its required notice.
- Add or change dependencies with `uv add --no-config …` / `uv lock --no-config`
  if your user-level uv configuration adds a private index, so no private URL
  reaches `uv.lock`.

## Model definition of done

From Phase 2, a model merges only when it meets ROADMAP §5 "Model quality &
governance", enforced by `registry.validate()` and the pull request template:

| Requirement      | Rule                                                                                         |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Identity         | Permanent dotted id; a per-model version that bumps on any output change                     |
| Model card       | Summary, formula, variables with units, assumptions, limitations, evidence status, curriculum mapping, references |
| Citations        | At least one primary reference; every golden case cites its source; no copied copyrighted text — numbers and formulas only, in our own words |
| Golden tests     | At least three cited cases including an edge case, each with a tolerance                     |
| Property tests   | One per invariant the domain guarantees                                                      |
| Units and bounds | Every numeric input and output                                                               |
| Parity           | Identical canonical outputs from Python, CLI, REST API, MCP and web                          |
| Hosted budget    | Declared compute cost class; heavy models get caps or async jobs in hosted mode              |
| Errata           | A shipped wrong number is a High defect: fixed, regression-tested, and logged on a public errata page |

A model is a pure function: it never fetches data, prints, plots or calls an
LLM. Never copy CFA Program curriculum text, questions or worked examples; cite
each formula's originators and take golden values from independent sources.
Requests outside the model layer are closed by citing
[ADR-0001](docs/adr/0001-product-boundaries.md) and ROADMAP §6.

## How roadmap steps run

The maintainer and coding agents implement the roadmap one step at a time, each
in its own branch, pull request and conversation. Every step follows a
six-stage lifecycle (ROADMAP §5 "Step lifecycle"):

1. **Create the branch** named on the step's `**Branch:**` line, from an
   up-to-date `main`, before any other work.
2. **Work on the branch**, passing the security gate on every commit.
3. **Open the pull request, then mark the step** `Complete — PR #n (date)` in
   its phase roadmap, on the same branch.
4. **Wait for green checks, then squash-merge.**
5. **Retire the branch** locally and remotely.
6. **Dispose of every finding, then declare completion.**

**Triage rule.** A finding that is not the step is classified before it is
acted on (ROADMAP §5 "Defect handling & triage"), and each class has one
destination and one label:

| Label          | Class                  | Destination                                                    |
|----------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `spec-rot`     | Spec rot               | Edit the step's task in the phase roadmap now                  |
| `upstream-gap` | Upstream gap           | Patch the earlier step's task; add it to the carry-over list   |
| `bug`          | Implementation bug     | Fix in-step only if it blocks the step; otherwise an issue     |
| `model-error`  | Model error            | High: a `fix/` branch, a golden test and an errata entry       |
| `architecture` | Architectural question | An issue for a future phase                                    |
| `process`      | Process improvement    | Written where the next session reads it; a check if it is a rule |
| `security`     | Security finding       | Jumps the queue by severity (SECURITY.md)                      |

A pull request contains its step plus blocking fixes only, and lists the issues
it opened.
