# Architecture Decision Records

These records hold the decisions every phase of the pyeconomics 1.0 rebuild
builds on: what the project is, how it is packaged, versioned and licensed,
how data licences are enforced, which web and documentation stacks it uses,
what it is called, and which Python versions it supports. Each one starts
from the recommended default in [ROADMAP §4 1.6](../roadmap/ROADMAP.md#16-architecture-decision-records)
and from the §5 section it implements.

compounding and day-count enums, tolerances, seeds) that Phase 2 writes when
it first needs them (ROADMAP §4 2.1).

## Lifecycle

1. **Proposed.** A new ADR is copied from [template.md](template.md), takes
   the next free number, and opens in a pull request reading
   `Status: Proposed`.
2. **Amended in place.** Until it is accepted, the maintainer's changes are
   made directly in the file, and each one is noted under "More
   information".
3. **Accepted.** The maintainer accepts each ADR explicitly in its pull
   request. Only then does its status line read `Status: Accepted`, with
   the acceptance date on its `Date:` line and in this index.
4. **Superseded, never edited.** Once accepted, an ADR's decision does not
   change. A new ADR supersedes it: the new one says `Supersedes
   ADR-NNNN`, and the old one's status becomes `Superseded by ADR-MMMM`.
   That status change, broken links and typos are the only edits an
   accepted ADR takes, plus one exception: a dated record of an action
   the ADR itself asks to be recorded. ADR-0009's domain registrar and
   renewal month are an example.

Each ADR's "Confirmation" section names the check that enforces it and the
roadmap step that builds that check. Facts that move, such as release
dates, version floors, licences, prices and name availability, carry a
source and an access date, or read TBD.
