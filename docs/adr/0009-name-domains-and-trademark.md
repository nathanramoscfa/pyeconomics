# ADR-0009: Name, domains and trademark

- Status: Proposed
- Date: 2026-10-05
- Deciders: Nathan Ramos, CFA (maintainer)
- Parent: ROADMAP §4 1.6 and 5.7; §5 "Legal & brand guardrails"; §1 note
  on similarly named projects; Gate G1 (§5 "Monetization strategy &
  validation gates")

## Context and problem

pyeconomics owns its PyPI name, but nothing else about its identity is
secured, and its current home breaks a rule it has set itself.

**The repository's address carries the CFA mark.**

- The repository lives at `github.com/nathanramoscfa/pyeconomics`, under
  the maintainer's personal handle, which contains "cfa".
- CFA Institute's guidance for charterholders answers "Can I use CFA/CIPM
  in a company name, product name, URL, email address, or social media
  handle?" with "No" [S1].
- ROADMAP §5 forbids "CFA" in any repository, domain or handle name.

**The domains are unregistered.**

- `pyeconomics.com`, `.org`, `.io` and `.dev` all returned "not found"
  from their registries' RDAP services on 2026-10-05: Verisign, Public
  Interest Registry, Identity Digital and Google Registry [S2].
- Nothing stops someone else from registering them once the project is
  announced.

**The GitHub name `pyeconomics` is taken.**

- `github.com/PyEconomics` is a user account created 2012-08-25, with no
  public repositories and no profile update since 2015-04-07 [S3].
- GitHub "do[es] not accept requests to release, transfer, or reclaim
  usernames on the basis that they appear inactive or unused". Only a
  valid trademark complaint can release one [S4].
- The roadmap's default organization name is therefore unavailable.

**The name may be hard to register as a trademark.**

- A mark is merely descriptive, and refused registration under Lanham Act
  §2(e)(1), if it "immediately conveys knowledge of a quality, feature,
  function, or characteristic" of the goods or services [S5].
- "PYECONOMICS" for economics software is at risk of that refusal.
- A merely descriptive mark may go on the Supplemental Register. An
  intent-to-use applicant cannot, until it has filed an acceptable
  allegation of use [S6].
- The PSF's trademark policy covers the word "Python", its logos, "PyCon"
  and "PyLadies". It places no restriction on a "Py" prefix [S7].

**Two similarly named projects exist.**

- `davidrpugh/pyeconomics`: "Computational economics in Python", 2013–14
  course code with no licence, last pushed 2014-01-16 [S8].
- pyecon.org: a site teaching Python for economics [S9].
- Neither is a package on PyPI.

## Decision drivers

- No "CFA" in any name the project uses.
- Secure the name's obvious domains before any announcement, at
  registry cost.
- Keep the trademark option open without spending on a filing that
  counsel has not advised (Gate G1).
- A neutral home that outlives the personal account and can take on
  maintainers.
- Every service that trusts the repository's identity (PyPI, TestPyPI,
  Read the Docs, branch protection, environments) keeps working after the
  move.

## Considered options

1. **Register the four domains now; search before any filing; move the
   repository to a neutral GitHub organization.** This is the roadmap's
   recommendation, with the organization renamed because `pyeconomics`
   is taken.
2. **Stay under the personal account.** No migration work, but the CFA
   mark stays in every repository, clone, issue and documentation URL,
   against CFA Institute's guidance [S1] and the project's own rule.
3. **File "PYECONOMICS" with the USPTO now.** Risks about $1,000 of fees
   [S10] on a likely descriptiveness refusal, before a search has said
   whether the name, or a coined brand, is the better bet.
4. **Claim the `pyeconomics` GitHub name.** Possible only through a
   trademark complaint [S4], which needs a registered or pending mark the
   project does not have. It stays available later, if a mark is
   registered.

## Decision outcome

Chosen option: **1**, because it removes the CFA mark from the project's
address, secures the domains for a few dollars a year, and defers the
trademark spend until a clearance search says it is worth it.

**Domains.**

- Register `pyeconomics.com`, `pyeconomics.org`, `pyeconomics.io` and
  `pyeconomics.dev` before any announcement.
- Use one registrar, with auto-renew on. The recommended registrar is
  Cloudflare Registrar, because:
  - it supports all four TLDs and sells at registry cost with no markup
    [S11];
  - it requires Cloudflare nameservers [S11], which ADR-0006 adopts
    anyway.
- `.dev` is HSTS-preloaded, so every `.dev` URL must serve HTTPS [S12].
- `.io` is a ccTLD whose future depends on the UK–Mauritius treaty on the
  Chagos Islands, signed 2025-05-22, whose UK implementing bill lapsed
  when Parliament was prorogued [S13]. If "IO" ever left ISO 3166-1, the
  retirement process allows about five years [S13]. So `.io` is held
  defensively and is never the canonical domain.
- Phase 5 chooses the canonical domain (ROADMAP §4 5.7–5.8).

**GitHub organization.**

- Create a free GitHub organization named **`pyeconomics-dev`**:
  - it follows the `pandas-dev/pandas` pattern;
  - it matches `pyeconomics.dev`;
  - it was free on 2026-10-05 [S3].
- The fallback is `pyeconomics-org`, also free [S3].
- The maintainer is its only owner, and the organization requires
  two-factor authentication for members, which the free plan supports
  [S14].
- Transfer `pyeconomics` into it, then verify every dependent setting by
  API: branch protection, rulesets, environments and their `pypi`
  reviewer, the secrets list, and Actions settings.
- Replace both trusted publishers. PyPI checks the repository owner's
  name and its numeric ID, and a transfer changes both [S15]. So a new
  publisher for `pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics` (same workflow and
  environments) is added on PyPI and TestPyPI, and the old ones removed.
- Reconnect Read the Docs to the moved repository [S16].
- Never create a repository at `nathanramoscfa/pyeconomics` again. Doing
  so deletes GitHub's redirect from the old URL [S17].
- The private research archive `nathanramoscfa/pyeconomics-research-archive`
  stays on the personal account. It is not a public surface.

**Trademark.**

1. Commission a clearance search before any filing.
2. If counsel advises filing, file an intent-to-use application in Nice
   classes 9 (downloadable software) and 42 (software as a service)
   [S18].
   - Government fees: $350 per class to file, plus $150 per class for the
     Statement of Use. That is about **$1,000 for two classes**, using ID
     Manual descriptions [S10].
   - Free-form descriptions add $200 per class, and each six-month
     Statement of Use extension adds $125 per class [S10].
   - Attorney fees: TBD.
3. A coined brand for the hosted product stays an option, if the search
   finds "PYECONOMICS" weak.
4. The maintainer schedules the search before the Phase 5 launch at the
   latest (ROADMAP §4 5.7).

**Names and distinction.**

- No package, module, command, repository, domain, subdomain or social
  handle contains "CFA" [S1].
- Project metadata (`pyproject.toml` authors, `CITATION.cff`, the
  security contact) uses an email address without "cfa". CFA Institute's
  guidance covers email addresses too [S1].
- The README states that pyeconomics is not `davidrpugh/pyeconomics` or
  pyecon.org.

### Consequences

Good:

- The project's address no longer carries the CFA mark. Old URLs and git
  remotes keep working through GitHub's redirect [S17].
- The four domains cost registry list price only and close off
  squatting.
- An organization can add maintainers, teams and Sponsors later without
  another move.
- No trademark money is spent before a search says it is worthwhile.

Bad:

- `pyeconomics-dev` is not the bare name, and the bare GitHub name stays
  with a dormant account unless a registered mark later supports a
  complaint.
- The move touches every trust relationship. Until each is re-verified, a
  release could fail on the stale trusted publisher. Phase 1 Steps 10 and
  12 run after the move, so they test the new home.
- Annual domain renewals: four registrations, cost TBD, at registry list
  price.
- The roadmap and agent instructions name `nathanramoscfa/pyeconomics` in
  many places. Later steps must use the new owner, and the redirect
  covers what is missed.

### Confirmation

| Check | Built in |
|-------|----------|
| RDAP shows all four domains registered (`.io` through Identity Digital's RDAP) | This step's acceptance; Phase 1 Step 12 `verify-phase01.sh --live` (V6.2) |
| `gh repo view --json nameWithOwner` names `pyeconomics-dev/pyeconomics`; the old URL redirects | This step's acceptance; Phase 1 Step 12 `--live` (V6.3) |
| After the move, API reads confirm protection, rulesets, environments with the `pypi` reviewer, secrets and Actions settings; the operator confirms both trusted publishers are replaced; Read the Docs builds `latest` | This step's acceptance |
| Static check 21: no package or module path, entry point, project URL, author email or extra name contains "cfa", case-insensitive | Phase 1 Step 12 (added to its task by this step) |
| The README distinction note and the CFA notice | Phase 1 Step 11 |
| Clearance search done, and a filing made if counsel advises one | Phase 5 (ROADMAP §4 5.7; 5.9 launch readiness gate) |
