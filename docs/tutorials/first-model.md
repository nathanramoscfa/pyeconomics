# Your first model

This notebook runs during every documentation build. It uses only local inputs.
We will calculate a holding-period return, inspect its evidence and make a table.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]

# Keep model and notebook execution offline after the local kernel starts.
from pytest_socket import disable_socket

disable_socket()
```

An investment starts at 100, ends at 108 and pays 2 in income. Its total return
is `(108 - 100 + 2) / 100`, or ten percent.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import pyeconomics

result = pyeconomics.run(
    "foundations.returns",
    calculation="holding_period",
    beginning_value=100,
    ending_value=108,
    income=2,
)
assert result.outputs.holding_period_return == 0.1
result.outputs
```

The card states the formula, variables, assumptions, limitations and sources.

```{code-cell} ipython3
from IPython.display import Markdown, display

display(Markdown(result.card().to_markdown()))
```

A table keeps inputs and outputs in separate columns and includes the result's
hash. The manifest has no timestamp, user, host or environment values.

```{code-cell} ipython3
table = result.to_pandas()
assert table.loc[0, "outputs.holding_period_return"] == 0.1
table
```

This example is educational, not investment advice. It describes a hypothetical
investment and makes no claim about future performance.
