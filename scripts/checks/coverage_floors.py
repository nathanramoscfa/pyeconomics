"""Fail if a package's branch coverage is below its floor.

pyproject.toml's `fail_under = 95` holds the whole package to 95%. This check
holds the two trees that matter most to their own floors (ROADMAP section 4 2.4,
"Model quality & governance"): `src/pyeconomics/core/` to 95% and
`src/pyeconomics/models/` to 90%, so a well-covered core cannot hide an untested
model, or the other way round.

It reads the JSON report `coverage json` writes. Coverage is coverage.py's own
measure with branch coverage on: covered statements plus covered branches, over
all statements plus all branches, the figure `coverage report` prints and
`fail_under` compares. `models/` with no measured statements passes with a note
(until Phase 2 Step 6 adds the first model); `core/` with none fails, because it
means the report's paths or coverage's `source_pkgs` no longer point at the
package, and a floor that measures nothing proves nothing.

Usage, from the repository root after `pytest --cov` (CI's tests job runs it):

    uv run coverage json -o coverage.json
    uv run python scripts/checks/coverage_floors.py coverage.json
