r"""Discounting cash flows: growth and annuity factors, present values and IRR.

Every function takes a rate per period as a decimal (ADR-0008 decision 1),
greater than -1, and a number of periods or a time in periods. Nothing here
raises on overflow: a factor or value too large for a float comes back as
infinity, and the model that called it decides what that means for its bounds
(ADR-0008 decision 10). That keeps NumPy's and ``math``'s overflow errors out of
models, whose tests turn warnings into errors.

- growth factor: :math:`(1 + r)^n`;
- annuity factor, in arrears: :math:`a = (1 - (1 + r)^{-n}) / r`, and :math:`n`
  at :math:`r = 0`;
- accumulated annuity factor: :math:`s = ((1 + r)^n - 1) / r`, and :math:`n` at
  :math:`r = 0`;
- growing annuity factor: :math:`(1 - q^n) / (r - g)` with
  :math:`q = (1 + g) / (1 + r)`, and :math:`n / (1 + r)` at :math:`r = g`;
- growing perpetuity factor: :math:`1 / (r - g)`, for :math:`r > g`;
- present value of cash flows: :math:`\sum_i C_i (1 + r)^{-t_i}`.

An annuity due (payments at the start of each period) is the arrears factor
times :math:`1 + r`.

Present values are summed in log space: each term is
:math:`\operatorname{sign}(C_i) e^{\ln|C_i| - t_i \ln(1+r) - m}` for the largest
log magnitude :math:`m`, so no term overflows. :func:`internal_rate_of_return`
finds a root of that scaled sum, which has the same sign and roots as the
present value itself, with :func:`~pyeconomics.core.numerics.find_root` (ADR-0008
decision 11): the smallest root in the bracket, with a ``several_roots`` warning
when the scan finds more than one.
