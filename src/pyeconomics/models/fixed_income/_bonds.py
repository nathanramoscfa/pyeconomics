r"""Bond terms, their cash flows and their prices: what the bond models share.

A bond's coupon dates step back from its maturity by whole periods (the
maturity anchors every date, so month ends do not drift). Interest accrues from
the previous coupon date, or from the issue date in the first coupon period,
which may be short (the stub before the first coupon date) or long (the stub
and the regular period after it). A regular coupon pays ``c / f`` of the face
value; the first coupon of an irregular period pays the year fraction of the
period under the bond's day count, so under ACT/ACT (ICMA) a short first coupon
is ``(r / s)(c / f)`` and a long one ``(1 + r / s)(c / f)``, as 31 CFR Part 356,
Appendix B, section I sets out for Treasury notes and bonds.

Time is counted in coupon periods from settlement. The time to the first
payment is its period less the part already accrued (``DSC = E - A``): under
ACT/ACT (ICMA), the days left over the days in the period. Its fractional part
:math:`w` is what remains of the period holding settlement; in the stub of a long
first period, the regular period after the stub is still to come in full. Each
later payment is a whole period after the one before. Two yield conventions
discount over those times, with :math:`v = 1 / (1 + y / f)`:

- **street**: :math:`P = \sum_j CF_j \, v^{t_j}`, compound over the fraction too;
- **treasury**: :math:`P = \sum_j CF_j \, v^{t_j - w} / (1 + w y / f)`, simple
  interest over the fraction, the formula of 31 CFR Part 356, Appendix B,
  section II.

Both agree when settlement falls on a coupon date. Nothing here does I/O.
