# Paste-prompt — write a phase roadmap

Fill the `{{placeholders}}`, then paste everything below the rule
into a **new** chat in the project and submit. Defaults are shown
for every placeholder; delete a bracketed line if it does not
apply.

| Placeholder          | Meaning                                   | Default                                    |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `{{N}}`              | Phase number (two digits in filenames)    | —                                          |
| `{{PROJECT_ROADMAP}}` | The parent project roadmap                | `@docs/roadmap/ROADMAP.md`                 |
| `{{OUTPUT}}`         | Where the phase roadmap is written        | `docs/roadmap/phase{{NN}}-roadmap.md`      |
| `{{PRIOR}}`          | Previous phase roadmap(s), for continuity | `@docs/roadmap/phase{{NN-1}}-roadmap.md`   |

Write the Phase {{N}} roadmap for this project.

Step 0 — refresh the planning kit so the templates and catalog are
current. Run `pip install -U roadmodel && roadmodel export-kit . --force`
(where roadmodel is not installed, run
`scripts/export-planning-kit.sh .` instead). Then open
`planning/templates/phase-roadmap-template.md` and confirm its Stage 3
reads "OPEN THE PR, THEN MARK THE STEP", its Stage 6 reads "DISPOSE
OF EVERY FINDING, DECLARE COMPLETION, THEN NEW CONVERSATION", and its
Step 1 has `**Status:** Not started` directly under the `## Step 1`
heading. If Stage 3 is a bare "OPEN THE PR", Stage 6 tells you to put
findings in a "Follow-ups (non-blocking)" note after the completion
line, a step's Status line sits after its `**Deploys:**` line, or its
Settings tables have no `Backup` row, STOP
and tell me the kit is stale — do not write the roadmap from it.

Step 0b — roadmaps live in `docs/roadmap/`: `ROADMAP.md` and every
`phaseNN-roadmap.md`, together. A project that keeps them git-excluded
(e.g. `private/`) keeps them there, and the rest of this step does not
apply: a tracked `ROADMAP.md` beside them is a published copy.
Otherwise, STOP and tell me to run `/roadmap-refresh` first when this
project's roadmaps have not moved yet: a `phaseNN-roadmap.md` that git
does not ignore (committed, or written and not yet committed) sits
outside `docs/roadmap/`, or `docs/roadmap/` holds no project roadmap
while this project's roadmap sits elsewhere. `/roadmap-refresh` moves
them into `docs/roadmap/` and updates every reference to them. Do not
write a new roadmap beside them. Once the project roadmap is in
`docs/roadmap/`, any other file named `ROADMAP.md` is a different
document (a brief's status page, a published copy): leave it alone. A
project roadmap written before this convention may carry another name
(e.g. `agentic-bot-farm-v1.md`); it is the file in `docs/roadmap/` the
phase roadmaps name as their parent.

Step 0c — this roadmap is written with the settings the project
roadmap names for it. Read the `### Phase {{N}}` section of
`{{PROJECT_ROADMAP}}` and its **Phase roadmap settings** table, and
print one line: `Phase {{N}} roadmap settings: Model <M> · Platform
<P> · <its dials, e.g. Effort Max · Thinking On>. This session: <your
own model> on <this surface>.`

- You are its Model on its Platform, or a newer version in the same
  line (Opus 5 → Opus 5.5, Fable 5 → Fable 5.1): continue, and say so
  on the line.
- You are its Backup on the backup's platform: continue — I have
  switched to it — and say so on the line.
- Anything else — a different line, an older version, another
  surface: STOP and tell me how to switch (Claude Code: `/model <M>`,
  then `/roadmap-phase {{N}}` again; elsewhere: the model picker and
  reasoning setting). Do not write the roadmap on a model it did not
  intend.
- You cannot see your own reasoning dial. `/roadmap-phase` sets Claude
  Code's effort to `Max` by itself, the deepest rung, so never below
  the table; pasted by hand, or on another surface, the printed line
  is my cue to set the dial before you go on.
- No such table (a project roadmap written before roadmodel 0.2.54):
  pick the settings now by the **Phase roadmap settings** rule in
  `planning/templates/project-roadmap-template.md`, print them on the
  same line, and apply the same checks. Leave the project roadmap as it
  is — `/roadmap-refresh` adds the table.

Step 1 — write `{{OUTPUT}}` from
`@planning/templates/phase-roadmap-template.md`, expanding the
Phase {{N}} section of `{{PROJECT_ROADMAP}}` into an executable plan.
Carry forward anything `{{PRIOR}}` hands to this phase (its closing
"inherits" line, its Not-in-scope items owned by this phase, and any
carry-over checklist).

For **each step's** Settings table and Model rationale, run the model
selector in `@planning/model-selector.txt` (prices from
`@planning/model-tier-cost-scale.md`, display rules from
`@planning/settings-display.md`) against `@planning/user-context.md`.
You are the engine — do not call any external API. Honor every
availability exclusion in the selector, and write each step's backup
model into its Settings table's Backup row, with the backup's own
platform and dial.

Honor the template's style rules: 80-column prose, zero `{{...}}`
tokens left, `**Status:** Not started` directly under the title and
directly under every `## Step` heading (the step's own PR flips it and
adds ✅ to the heading — Status rule), a Status column in the Summary
Table, every `<task>` block
carrying the full `<lifecycle>` and `<security>` blocks verbatim, and
a Post-Implementation Verification section.

When the file is written, reply with its path and a one-paragraph
summary of the steps and their models. Do not start Step 1 of the
phase — that is a separate conversation.
