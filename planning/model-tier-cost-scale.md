# Model Tier Cost Scale

Tier classification is based solely on **Output price per 1M tokens** from each
provider's published API pricing. The four-tier scale below defines the
boundary used in `model-selector.txt`.

## Tier Boundaries


| Tier      | Output price (per 1M tokens) |
| --------- | ---------------------------- |
| Low       | < $10                        |
| Medium    | $10 – $14.99                 |
| High      | $15 – $24.99                 |
| Very High | ≥ $25                        |


*Boundary is inclusive on the lower end of each tier (e.g. exactly $10 → Medium,
exactly $15 → High, exactly $25 → Very High).*

## Full Model Pricing Reference

Prices sourced from Cursor's model pricing page (Cursor Models pool + Other Models pool).
All prices are per 1M tokens. The **Notes** column mirrors the rightmost cell of
each row in Cursor's `models-and-pricing` Markdown source — these are the
hovertext annotations that appear next to the info icon in Cursor's IDE pricing
table and surface material cost / availability / capability constraints.

## Subscription Tiers and Access Methods

The per-token tables above are one dimension of cost. Many of the same
models are reachable through flat-monthly subscription plans whose
marginal cost per call is effectively $0 until the subscription's usage
budget or token pool is exhausted. The selector's `<access-selection>`
step uses this table to rank platforms; the user-specific subscription
state lives in [`docs/user-context.md`](user-context.md).

This table is a DERIVED VIEW of each provider's official pricing page,
rebuilt weekly by [`update/update_models.py`](../update/update_models.py)
using Anthropic's `web_search` server-side tool per the rules in
[`update/prompt.md`](../update/prompt.md) § "Subscription tiers". Each
run discovers the canonical pricing page for every provider enumerated
in `<access-methods>` of [`docs/model-selector.txt`](model-selector.txt),
enumerates the consumer tiers shown, and writes the resulting row set
into this table. Manual edits to the table body will be overwritten on
the next run. To change which providers are in scope, edit
`<access-methods>` (which is editorial and remains protected by the
existing model-lifecycle rules); the next cron run picks up the new
provider automatically.

The **`Annual`** column (the full yearly total in USD) is rebuilt by the
same `web_search` pass as the monthly price, with two safeguards (see
[`update/prompt.md`](../update/prompt.md) § "Annual column"): a **sanity
guard** accepts a captured annual `A` for a tier with monthly `M` only
when `8 × M ≤ A ≤ 12 × M` (a real annual discount, never a misparse), and
**preserve-on-miss** keeps the existing cell verbatim when no annual is
found or the guard trips — so a transient fetch miss never downgrades a
known-good price. A tier with no annual plan carries `—` (parsed as a
null `annual_usd`, which suppresses the annual price + savings in the UI
without breaking the tier). To pin or correct an annual price by hand,
edit the cell directly; the next rebuild keeps it unless it re-derives a
guarded value that differs (and then logs the change).

`tests/test_subscription_freshness.py` watches the
`<!-- subscription-tiers-reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->` marker above. The
cron bumps the marker to today's date only when every in-scope
provider's rebuild completed without tripping a sanity guard; a stale
marker (>180 days) therefore means the cron has been running but
subscription rebuild has been persistently failing — most likely a
provider has redesigned its pricing page in a way the AI can no longer
parse cleanly. When that happens, eyeball the failing provider's page
and adjust the rebuild rules in [`update/prompt.md`](../update/prompt.md).

The "Access methods unlocked" column references method ids enumerated in
the `<access-methods>` block of
[`docs/model-selector.txt`](model-selector.txt). The dollar values are
list prices at time of writing; verify against each provider's billing
page before publishing.

Subscriptions whose surface is web-chat-only (no CLI / IDE / API path
beyond a chat box) are intentionally omitted — only subscriptions that
unlock at least one access method enumerated in `<access-methods>`

Routing meta-models (Cursor's "Auto" / "Premium" modes; analogous
routers from other providers) are intentionally NOT enumerated in
`docs/model-selector.txt` `<model-options>`. The catalog tracks fixed-
engine models only — a routing model's benchmarks, jurisdiction, and
cost are by construction unknowable in advance, which conflicts with
the selector's per-model tier ratings and the jurisdiction filter
(see `<jurisdiction-context>` in `docs/model-selector.txt` for the
rationale). The "Cursor Models Pool" table at the top of this
document continues to document Cursor's first-party model pricing for
reference (Grok 4.5, Grok 4.6, Grok 4.7, Composer 2.5, plus their Fast
variants), but the `auto` and `premium` model ids no longer appear as
recommendable engines.

| ------------------ | ------ | ---- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Gemini 3.5 Flash-Lite | $2.50 | Low | New 2026-10-07 via the provider-discovery lane. Google's own Gemini API pricing page now prices gemini-3.5-flash-lite at $0.30/$2.50 (previously listed there without a price), and it is not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct (Federation rule: prices owned by the Google provider snapshot). The selector pass adds it to `<model-options>` in the Low bucket |
| Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite | $1.50 | Low | New 2026-10-07 via the provider-discovery lane. Google's own Gemini API pricing page now prices gemini-3.1-flash-lite at $0.25/$1.50 (previously listed there without a price), and it is not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct (Federation rule: prices owned by the Google provider snapshot). The selector pass adds it to `<model-options>` in the Low bucket |
| GPT-6.1 Sol        | $10.00 | Medium | New 2026-10-01 via the provider-discovery lane. OpenAI's own pricing page lists gpt-6.1-sol at $2/$10, and it is not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct (Federation rule: prices owned by `catalog-openai.json`). The selector pass adds it to `<model-options>` in the Medium bucket |
| Claude Sonnet 5.5  | $10.00 | Medium | New 2026-09-29 on Cursor's pricing page — Anthropic's Sonnet 5 successor at the same $2/$10 rates (US-only endpoints 10% higher at $2.20/$11); visible by default. Selector pass adds it to `<model-options>`; Anthropic is provider-direct, so `catalog-anthropic.json` must carry it for the G4 gate |
| Claude Sonnet 5    | $10.00 | Medium | Notes refreshed 2026-09-29 — Cursor flipped Sonnet 5 to "Hidden by default" after the Sonnet 5.5 launch (pricing unchanged) |
| GLM 5.3            | $4.40  | Low  | New 2026-09-29 on Cursor's pricing page — z.ai's GLM 5.3 at the same $1.40/$4.40 rates as GLM 5.2 (Hidden by default) |
| GLM 5.3 Flash      | $0.50  | Low  | New 2026-09-29 on Cursor's pricing page — z.ai's GLM 5.3 Flash at $0.15/$0.50 (Hidden by default) |
| GPT-6 Astra        | $50.00 | Very High | New 2026-09-25 via the provider-discovery lane — OpenAI's own pricing page lists gpt-6-astra at $10/$50; not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct (Federation rule: prices owned by `catalog-openai.json`) |
| GPT-6 Sol          | $10.00 | Medium | New 2026-09-25 via the provider-discovery lane — OpenAI's own pricing page lists gpt-6-sol at $2/$10; not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct |
| GPT-6 Luna         | $0.50  | Low  | New 2026-09-25 via the provider-discovery lane — OpenAI's own pricing page lists gpt-6-luna at $0.10/$0.50; not on Cursor's pricing page. Provider-direct |
| Claude Opus 5.5    | $20.00 | High | New 2026-09-23 on Cursor's pricing page — Anthropic's Opus 5 successor at $4/$20 (20% cheaper than Opus 5 on input and output); prompt-cache reads $0.20/M (0.05x input, down from 0.10x on Opus 5); regional and US-only endpoints priced 10% higher ($4.40/$22); visible by default (not Hidden). Selector-pass will add to `<model-options>` per the Anthropic Federation rule (input/output owned by `catalog-anthropic.json`) |
| Claude Fable 5.1   | $50.00 | Very High | Notes refreshed 2026-09-23 — Cursor updated the Fable 5.1 hovertext from "About 2x the cost of Claude Opus 5" to "About 2.5x the cost of Claude Opus 5.5 on input and output" following the Opus 5.5 launch (Fable 5.1 pricing itself unchanged at $10/$50) |
| Grok 4.7           | $6.00  | Low  | New 2026-09-22 in the Cursor Models pool — xAI/SpaceXAI released Grok 4.7 on 2026-09-21 as a same-price, same-speed upgrade over Grok 4.6 at $2/$6 (2.1T parameters, 500K context, xhigh reasoning). Fast variant $4/$12 (Medium tier); 500k long-context variant $4/$12 (Medium tier); 500k Fast variant $6/$18 (High tier). Not yet added to `<model-options>` (selector-pass will handle) |
| Grok 4.7 (Fast)    | $12.00 | Medium | New 2026-09-22 Cursor first-party Fast variant of Grok 4.7 (2x standard rates for higher output speed)                     |
| Grok 4.7 500k      | $12.00 | Medium | New 2026-09-22 Cursor first-party long-context (>256k) variant of Grok 4.7 (2x standard rates apply to all tokens)         |
| Grok 4.7 500k (Fast) | $18.00 | High | New 2026-09-22 Cursor first-party long-context Fast variant of Grok 4.7 (3x standard rates for combined fast + long context) |
| deepseek-flash     | $0.60  | Low  | New 2026-09-21 (editorial, closes #583 / #606) — DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash under the API name `deepseek-flash`, the provider-direct successor to `deepseek-v4-flash`: $0.15/$0.60 off-peak ($0.30/$1.20 peak), 1M context, native image input (V4-Flash-Vision-Exp folded in), AA Intelligence Index 39.5 (v4.3). Tier ratings inherited from V4-Flash except multimodal D→C; MIT weights on Hugging Face |
| deepseek-v4-flash  | —      | —    | RETIRED 2026-09-21 from `<model-options>` — DeepSeek retired DeepSeek-V4-Flash-0731 (and -Vision-Exp) from its pricing page 2026-09-17; the legacy API names are still accepted but served by DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash at the Flash price, so the element is replaced by `deepseek-flash` rather than kept |
| deepseek-v4-pro    | $1.98  | Low  | Price basis made explicit 2026-09-21 — DeepSeek's pricing page splits every rate into OFF-PEAK / PEAK (peak = 2×, 01:00–04:00 and 06:00–10:00 UTC Mon–Fri only); the catalog lists the OFF-PEAK rate for both DeepSeek models (~79% of the week, all US/EU working hours) and the snapshot records `price_basis` + the peak figures. Aggregators such as OpenRouter list the PEAK rate ($1.32/$3.96) |
| Composer 1         | —      | —    | REMOVED 2026-09-17 from cost scale — Cursor's pricing page no longer lists Composer 1 in any pool (Composer 2.5 supersedes it in the Cursor Models pool) |
| Muse Spark 1.3     | $4.25  | Low  | New 2026-09-10 on Cursor's pricing page — Meta's Muse Spark 1.3 at $1.25/$4.25 (first Meta-provider entry in the cost scale); requires Max Mode on legacy request-based plans with 1M context available in Max Mode |
| GPT-5.1 Codex Mini | $2.00  | Low  | New 2026-09-10 on Cursor's pricing page — smaller/cheaper GPT-5.1 Codex variant at $0.25/$2.00 (4x rate limits vs GPT-5.1 Codex, Hidden by default) |
| Grok 4.6           | $6.00  | Low       | New 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page — Cursor first-party model at $2/$6 (mirrors Grok 4.5 pricing), jointly trained by Cursor and SpaceXAI. Fast variant $4/$12 (Medium tier). Not yet added to `<model-options>` (selector-pass will handle) |
| Claude Fable 5.1   | $50.00 | Very High | New 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page — Anthropic's Fable 5 successor at $10/$50 (same tier pricing as Fable 5); cache-read reduced 75% to $0.25/M vs Fable 5's $1/M. Not yet added to `<model-options>` (selector-pass will handle) |
| Gemini 3.7 Flash   | $3.50  | Low       | New 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page — Google's Gemini 3.7 Flash at $0.75/$3.50 (Hidden by default). Not yet added to `<model-options>` |
| Gemini 3.8 Flash   | $3.50  | Low       | New 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page — Google's Gemini 3.8 Flash at $0.75/$3.50 (visible, not Hidden by default); supersedes Gemini 3.7 in same series at equal output price. Not yet added to `<model-options>` |
| gpt-5.6-sol        | $20.00 | High      | Price DROPPED 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page from $5/$30 to $4/$20 (promotional pricing through November 21, 2026); tier moves Very High → High as a result. Notes updated to add long-context clauses and promotional-pricing disclosure |
| gpt-5.6-terra      | $12.00 | Medium    | Price DROPPED 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page from $2.50/$15 to $2/$12; tier moves High → Medium. Notes updated to add "Requires Max Mode on legacy request-based plans" prefix and long-context clauses |
| gpt-5.6-luna       | $1.20  | Low       | Price DROPPED 2026-09-04 on Cursor's pricing page from $1/$6 to $0.20/$1.20 (5x cheaper output); Notes updated to add "Requires Max Mode on legacy request-based plans" prefix and long-context clauses; still Low tier |
| Claude Sonnet 5    | $10.00 | Medium    | Corrected 2026-09-12 from $3/$15 (High) to $2/$10 (Medium): Anthropic's own pricing page, mirrored in `catalog-anthropic.json`, lists $2/$10 as the standard rate, so the launch-promotion clause is retired from the Notes column; the selector was corrected in roadmodel 0.2.31 and the cost scale now matches it |
| Grok 4.6 (Fast)    | $12.00 | Medium    | New 2026-09-04 Cursor first-party Fast variant of Grok 4.6                                                                 |
| Grok 4.5 (Fast)    | $18.00 | High      | New 2026-09-04 Cursor first-party Fast variant of Grok 4.5                                                                 |
| Composer 2.5 (Fast) | $15.00 | High   | New 2026-09-04 Cursor first-party Fast variant of Composer 2.5                                                             |
| Auto (pool rate)   | —      | —         | REMOVED 2026-09-04 — Cursor's pricing page no longer lists a separate "Auto" billed line item; the Cursor Models pool now enumerates the covered first-party models (Grok 4.6, Grok 4.5, Composer 2.5) directly, and Auto routing bills at the routed model's list price |
| Claude Opus 5      | $25.00 | Very High | New 2026-08-05 on Cursor's pricing page — Anthropic's Opus 5 successor at $5/$25 (same tier pricing as Opus 4.7/4.8); requires Max Mode on legacy request-based plans; native 1M context via extended-context toggle |
| Gemini 3.6 Flash   | $7.50  | Low       | New 2026-08-05 on Cursor's pricing page — Google's Gemini 3.6 Flash at $1.50/$7.50. Reportedly released 2026-07-21. Now Hidden by default (was visible on initial listing) |
| Kimi K3            | $15.00 | High      | New 2026-08-05 on Cursor's pricing page — Moonshot's Kimi K3 at $3/$15 with 1M extended-context support at flat per-token rates |
| claude-sonnet-5    | $10.00 | Medium    | Price CORRECTED 2026-09-05 to $2/$10 from Anthropic's own pricing page, which is authoritative for Anthropic models per the Federation rule; tier High → Medium. The catalog had carried the aggregator mirror's $3/$15 because update/extract_anthropic_catalog.py had been failing silently since the page restyled its "Base input tokens" header, and claude-sonnet-5 was never in that extractor's name map — so G4 had nothing to reconcile. The July note called $2/$10 a promotion through 2026-08-31; Anthropic lists it as the standard rate today |
| gpt-5.6-sol        | $30.00 | Very High | Initial listing 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — OpenAI's GPT-5.6 Sol flagship at $5/$30 (mirrors GPT-5.5 pricing); requires Max Mode on request-based plans |
| gpt-5.6-terra      | $15.00 | High      | Initial listing 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — GPT-5.6 Terra mid-tier variant at $2.50/$15                           |
| gpt-5.6-luna       | $6.00  | Low       | Initial listing 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — smallest GPT-5.6 variant at $1/$6, optimized for cost and speed       |
| gpt-5.2-codex      | $14.00 | Medium    | New 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — Codex variant of GPT-5.2 at $1.75/$14 (same pricing as GPT-5.2, agentic + reasoning) |
| gpt-5.1-codex-max  | $10.00 | Medium   | New 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — GPT-5.1 Codex Max at $1.25/$10                                                    |
| kimi-k2.7-code     | $4.00  | Low       | New 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — Moonshot's Kimi K2.7 Code at $0.95/$4 (supersedes Kimi K2.5 row; K2.5 no longer on Cursor's pricing page) |
| grok-4.5           | $6.00  | Low       | New 2026-07-15 on Cursor's pricing page — jointly trained by Cursor and SpaceXAI, first-party model; not yet available in the EU |
| glm-5.2            | $4.40  | Low       | New 2026-06-27 in cost-scale — z.ai's GLM 5.2 now visible on Cursor's pricing page (provider header "Z.ai"); already present in `<model-options>` via provider-direct `zai-api` method, prices preserved per the Federation rule (provider-direct catalog owns input/output) |
| grok-4.3           | $2.50  | Low       | LEFT Cursor's pricing page 2026-07-15 (Grok 4.5 is Cursor's first-party replacement) but RETAINED in `<model-options>` as provider-direct via the `xai-api` method — still on xAI's own API at $1.25/$2.50; prices owned by `catalog-xai.json` per the Federation rule (xAI is now `overlay_mode: whole-element`, like DeepSeek) |
| grok-build-0.1     | —      | —         | REMOVED 2026-07-15 from Cursor's pricing page — Grok Build 0.1 no longer listed                                             |
| composer-2         | —      | —         | REMOVED 2026-07-15 from Cursor's pricing page — Composer 2 removed in favor of Composer 2.5 (2.5 supersedes 2 in Cursor's own listing) |

| gemini-2.5-flash   | $2.50  | Low       | New — added 2026-05-21; cheap multimodal Flash model now visible in `<model-options>` for SaaS-backend free-tier picks      |
| gemini-3-flash     | $3.00  | Low       | New — added 2026-05-21; Gemini 3 generation Flash variant; previously Hidden-by-default on Cursor's pricing page            |
| gemini-3-pro       | $12.00 | Medium    | New — added 2026-05-21; Gemini 3 generation Pro variant alongside gemini-3.1-pro                                            |
| gemini-3.5-flash   | $9.00  | Low       | New — added 2026-05-24; Gemini 3.5 Flash visible (un-hidden) on Cursor's pricing page; AA Intelligence Index 55.3 (high reasoning) places it as the strongest Flash-tier Gemini |
| gpt-5              | $10.00 | Medium    | New — added 2026-05-21; baseline GPT-5 family flagship                                                                      |

| kimi-k2.5          | $3.00  | Low       | New — added 2026-05-21; Moonshot's Kimi K2.5 (routed via Cursor pool; no direct Moonshot access method enumerated yet)      |
| opus-4.8           | $25.00 | Very High | Benchmarks indexed 2026-06-04 — AA Intelligence Index 61.4 (#1), HLE 45.7%, Terminal-Bench Hard 58.3, τ²-bench retail 94.4%; tier-agentic bumped from A to S based on Terminal-Bench Hard + τ²-bench evidence |
| auto               | —      | —         | REMOVED 2026-05-21; Cursor-managed routing meta-model. Opaque routing conflicts with per-model tier ratings + jurisdiction filter |
| premium            | —      | —         | REMOVED 2026-05-21; Cursor-managed routing meta-model. Same rationale as `auto` removal                                     |

## Provider Jurisdictions

The selector's [`<jurisdiction-context>`](model-selector.txt) filter
consumes this reference table when applying the user's allowed-
jurisdictions list. Each row maps a provider HQ to an ISO-3166-1
alpha-2-style code; the `jurisdiction` attribute on every
`<model>` in `<model-options>` and the `provider-jurisdiction`
attribute on every `<method>` in `<access-methods>` derive from
this table.


| Provider HQ name              | Jurisdiction code | Models in catalog                                                                                                       |

| Cursor (San Francisco, US)    | `us`              | composer-2, composer-2.5 — note: base weights for these Composer models derive from Moonshot's Kimi K2 series; Cursor's operator status determines the jurisdiction code per `<jurisdiction-context>` (data flow governed by Cursor's privacy policy and US law) |

Notes on the mapping:

- The jurisdiction code reflects the **operator** — the entity whose
  terms govern the data flow when a call is placed — not the base-
  weight origin. Composer 2 / Composer 2.5 are `us` because Cursor
  operates them; the Moonshot lineage is disclosed in the model's
  `best-for` for users whose compliance posture cares about base-
  weight origin.
- Newly-detected providers default to `unknown` per
  [`update/prompt.md`](../update/prompt.md)'s auto-add rule;
  maintainer fills them in editorially after one refresh cycle.
- This table is the source of truth — the per-model `jurisdiction`
  attribute and the per-method `provider-jurisdiction` attribute
  in `model-selector.txt` MUST match the codes in this table
  byte-for-byte. CI tests enforce the cross-doc invariant.

## Declined Models (discovery lane)

Models a provider's own pricing page lists that this catalog deliberately
does not carry. When the catalog cron declines a model the discovery lane
flags (`update/discovery.py`), it adds a line here and the flag stops. One
model per line, in exactly this form:
`- <provider>/<slug> — <reason> (declined YYYY-MM-DD)`.

- anthropic/Claude Mythos 5 — provider-page name for the Fable 5 model already carried as claude-fable-5 (identical $10/$50 pricing; Fable 5 is the Mythos-class model) (declined 2026-09-25)
- anthropic/Claude Mythos 5.1 — provider-page name for the Fable 5.1 model already carried as claude-fable-5.1 (identical $10/$50 pricing) (declined 2026-09-25)
- google/Gemini 2.5 Computer Use — computer-use variant, not a general text model (declined 2026-09-25)
- xai/grok-4.20-0309-non-reasoning — dated (0309) snapshot of the Grok 4.20 generation; the catalog carries grok-4.3 / grok-4.6 / grok-4.7 as the Grok line (declined 2026-09-25)
- xai/grok-4.20-0309-reasoning — dated (0309) snapshot of the Grok 4.20 generation; the catalog carries grok-4.3 / grok-4.6 / grok-4.7 as the Grok line (declined 2026-09-25)
- xai/grok-4.20-multi-agent-0309 — dated (0309) multi-agent variant of the Grok 4.20 generation; not a fixed single-engine model the catalog tracks (declined 2026-09-25)
- xai/grok-build-0.1 — build-agent preview removed from the catalog on 2026-07-15 when Cursor delisted it; retired (declined 2026-09-25)
- google/Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite Image — an image, audio, video, embedding, robotics or computer-use model; the catalog rates general text models (declined 2026-10-07)
- google/Gemini Robotics Er 2 — an image, audio, video, embedding, robotics or computer-use model; the catalog rates general text models (declined 2026-10-07)
